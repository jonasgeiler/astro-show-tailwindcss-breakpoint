## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── app.ts
├── index.ts
└── package.json
```

The logic of your app is in the appropriately named `app.ts` file. This is where the vast majority of your toolbar app logic will live.

The `index.ts` file is a simple Astro integration file that will be used to add your app into the toolbar.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                             |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`   | Installs dependencies                              |
| `pnpm dev`   | Watch for changes and build your app automatically |
| `pnpm build` | Build your app to `./dist/`                        |
